1. Prepare 5 t3.medium, terminate a node to test the failover time of the cluster hosting node group without workload and with workload
without workload：
First records the TerminateInstances event corresponding to the node termination instance and uses its "event time" as the failover start time of the cluster management node group. Then, find the RegisterTargets event of the Pod registered to the ALB and record its "event time" as the failover end time. Calculate the time difference between the two times as the failover completion time.

with workload：
run the command:
Install Apache ab 
sudo yum -y install httpd-tools 
Generate workloads using Apache ab 
ab -c 100 -n 100000 https://www.google.com/?hl=zh_CN{can change your url} 

2. Prepare 5 t3.medium, initial deployment of 20 Pods, expanded to 40 Pods through HPA to test the expansion time of the cluster hosting node group under no workload and with workload
The configuration of HPA can refer to the article： https://cloud.baidu.com/article/3262717

The configuration of cloudtrail can refer to the article： https://docs.aws.amazon.com/zh_cn/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-tutorial.html

scale command： 
kubectl scale deployment deployment-nginx --replicas 40 -n namespace-nginx && date 

also use cloudtrail to get the experence results.
